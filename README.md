# Real-estate-image-classification

## Introduction:
Real estate agents spend considerable time sifting through huge amounts of image data in order to determine which ones to use in advertising a property .This is a real estate image classification problem where the objective is to classify images with respective classes with high accuracy.

## Business Problem:
Posting pictures is a necessary part of advertising a home for sale. Agents typically sort through dozens of images from which to pick the most complimentary ones. This is a manual effort involving annotating images accompanied by descriptions (bedroom, bathroom, attic, etc.). When volumes are small, manual annotation is not a problem, but there is a point where this becomes too burdensome and ultimately infeasible.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains 5859 images distributed across 6 classes: Bathroom, Bedroom, Living Room, Kitchen, Front Yard, and Backyard. The number of images varies across classes, but each class contains at least 700 images. Images are in .jpg, .jpeg and .PNG format.
